Here is a quick summary of what each program here does
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Autoclicker - A simple autoclicker that lets you choose a random click interval from a given range.

Calculator - A price calculator that can calculate the price of any product based on weight and user-determined prices. Supports grams, kilograms, pounds, and ounces.

Coin Flipper - Flips heads or tails randomly with user-defined trial size and number. Program writes data to file and records the entire trial including statistical data such as outliers and extreme outliers, as well as their percentages.

Folder Organizer - Takes every file in a directory and organizes it into folders from #, A, B, C through Z and removes any empty folders that result from this process. This is useful full organizing folders containing many files (in my case, a huge folder containing emulator ROMs)

Folder Extractor - Basically the reverse process of the Folder Organizer. Program moves every file within a directory back to the root directory. WARNING: If you do use this, the program does NOT handle directories within directories and will error out if you try this (it will backup your data first, however)

Roulette Simulator - A text-based roulette simulator game

Roulette Simulator GUI - The roulette simulator with a GUI made using tkinter
